One of my lockdown activities has been remotely watching short movies with a friend. Here are a few of them, from best to worst.



[Emilie Muller](https://www.filmsshort.com/short-film-pages/emilie-muller-yvon-marciano.html). A young woman attends an audition, where the director requires her to talk him through the contents of her handbag. As their conversation veers into more personal territory, we become very aware of the power dynamics and the patterns of self-dramatization. Along the way, though, there is some lovely slice-of-life discussion sparked by the objects.



[House Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMFK7XBvjZA&ab_channel=CINEPUB). A Romanian woman comes home, to find her teenage son has thrown a house party in her absence. This short is much subtler than you might expect from the set-up. Its heart is the relationship between the women living in the same apartment block. I suspect much of the nuance has been lost in translation, but still worth watching.



[The Jigsaw](https://www.filmsshort.com/short-film-pages/the-jigsaw-basil-al-safar-rashad-al-safar.html). A dusty, little-frequented shop. You try to buy a jigsaw. The shopkeeper tries to discourage you with mysterious warnings, before finally relenting and selling you the puzzle.
Yes, you are in a horror film. Yes, every trope is going to be played absolutely straight. No, this one doesn't have much to recommend it
