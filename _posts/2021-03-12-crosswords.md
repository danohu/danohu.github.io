The cryptic crossword has a special place in my heart, alongside cricket, as a British obsession which it is near impossible to describe to foreigners*. Start trying to explain either, and they will (quite reasonably) conclude that you are pulling their leg.



How _can_ you explain something like this?

I haven't a clue.

Being fairly incompetent at solving crosswords, I'm happy watching youtube videos where somebody else works their way through a crossword. While there are less of these than I might have expected, those I do find are a nice combination of soothing and stimulating:

And yes, when I showed this to my (non-British) boyfriend, he only half-believed that I was not making it up.



(*) Non-commonwealth followers, I should probably say. From India to Australia: where there is cricket there are also crosswords
