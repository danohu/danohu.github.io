In discussions about Trump's sanity, I've felt the need to bring up the immortal words of Harold Wilson, speaking to a pair of journalists shortly after he stepped down as Prime Minister:

> I see myself as the big fat spider in the corner of the room. Sometimes I speak when I'm asleep. You should both listen. Occasionally when we meet I might tell you to go the Charing Cross Road and kick a  blind man. That blind man may tell you something.

In other words: power attracts strange people and makes them even stranger.
