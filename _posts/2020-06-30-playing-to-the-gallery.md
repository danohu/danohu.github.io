Grayson Perry has found himself a niche in the British media as a guide to modern art. In this short book he sets out to '*answer the basic questions that might come up when we enter an art gallery*'

Alas, the questions he answers are mostly about *the art world*, not about *art*. There is plenty about turf wars between gallerists and collectors, about young artists' assigned role as accepted rebels, about the role of money in art.

What's missing is any suggestion that art might have something to say about the wider world.

If I'm in an art gallery, I'll be wondering something like "*what feelings can this art inspire in me?*", or "*will this change the way I look at the world?*". That kind of question doesn't seem relevant to Grayson Perry.
