Last night I ventured out to a lake to watch the Perseid meteor shower.

I had the predictable city-boi revelation that yes, there really are stars in the sky. But -- I grew up  in the countryside, so I have some vague memory that there are Things Up There.

What I had not expected were the satellites. I'm sure that back in the 90s, when little-me was lying on their back in nighttime fields, spotting a satellite was at least mildly exciting. Now, it seems there is no moment without them.

So I looked it up. The number of satellites has indeed quintupled since I was a kid, and has doubled in just the past 6 years. It's bewildering that the night sky has changed so much while I wasn't paying attention.
