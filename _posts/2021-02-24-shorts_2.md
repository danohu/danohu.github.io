Some more notes from my weekly short film sessions



[Next Floor](https://www.filmsshort.com/short-film-pages/next-floor-denis-villeneuve.html)

Rich gluttons wreak devastation on the world around them. Visually effective, but pretty heavy-handed



[Brick Novax's Diary](https://www.filmsshort.com/short-film-pages/brick-novaxs-diary-matt-piedmont.html)

Animation about a over-the-top All-American hero/villain.  A parody of the macho guns-and-girls action genre, except that it falls in love with its own hero. Even the entertaining parts leave a sour taste.



[The Duel at Blood Creek](https://www.filmsshort.com/short-film-pages/the-duel-at-blood-creek-leo-burton.html)

A formal duel, with its elaborate rituals, is always teetering on the edge of bathos. This pushes it over, and then keeps going.  Unlike _Brick Novax's Diary_, manages to keep a tone of affectionate ridicule. Slightly let down by the ending
